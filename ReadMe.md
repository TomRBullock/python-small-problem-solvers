# Small Problems solved using Python

* All Square

     This program works out and returns all numbers that produce perfect squares where the perfect square is the sum of 3 other square numbers. 

     example : 5^2 + 6^2 + 30^2 = 961

     sqrt(961) = 31


* Anagram

     This program takes two string parameters and works out if they are anagrams of each other.
     
     It ignores capital letters and spaces.

* Closest to Zero

     This program takes an array of floats and identifies the number closest to zero. It will prioratise a possivite number over a negative number. Eg, 1.4 would be selected instead of -1.4 if they were both in the list
